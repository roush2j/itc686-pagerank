\section{Implementation} \label{sec:results}

The full source code (including the source of this report) is available on github

The intermediate results from our attempted runs are available on S3 (in machine-browsable form only):

Unfortunately, we do not have full results available.  As discussed in Section
\ref{sec:impl}, running our MR jobs on Amazon EMR proved far more challenging
than expected.  We eventually solved the arcane configuration issues - but it turns
out that Amazon tightly caps the horizontal scalability of their clusters, and
they declined to offer us an exception.  Thus, EMR turned out to be not much
faster than a single machine for our purposes.  Consequently, we were unable to
complete the full preprocessing step or a full PageRank iteration.

We did, however, run several iterations of PageRank on a reduced subset on the
full web crawl data.  This validated our implementation and provides some
tangible results.  Because the subset was quite small, however, the majority of 
pages in it simply do not link to each other - not a very interesting web
structure.

In conclusion, then, our implementation appears to be correct, but technical 
factors and time limitations prevented it from being full utilized.
